Urban Sensing Through Bus-Based Mobility

This project is a bus-based sensing platform for Smart Cities. It is a mobile wireless sensor network with three layers: sensing, flushing, and publishing. The sensing layer is composed with sensor nodes coupled embedded into buses, the flushing layer are access points mounted onto bus stops and the publishing layer is a server on a distributed cloud. These layers are mapped into the architecture of the current project.  

## Architecture
This project has three main components:
- The sensing node
- The flushing node
- The publishing node

These components are explained in detail throughout the next sections
