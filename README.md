Urban Sensing Through Bus-Based Mobility

This project is a bus-based sensing platform for Smart Cities. In a broader view, sensor nodes, embbeded onto buses, gather data about the city. Such data is delivered to users using access points mounted into the bus stops of the city. Data is presented to users using a cloud service. The whole schema is shown below:

The schema is abstracted in three layers: sensing, flushing, and publishing. These layers are mapped into the architecture of the current project.

## Architecture
This project has three main layers, as shown:

The Sensing layer is responsible for gathering raw data from the city. It is composed by wireless sensor nodes embbeded onto urban buses of public transportation.

The Flushing layer receives raw data directly from the Sensing layer and sends it to the Publishing layer, through the Internet. It is composed by access points, mounted on bus stops.

The Publishing layer receives data from all the nodes in the Flushing layer and serves data to the users, using an API and a web interface. This layer is composed by a server running on a distributed cloud.

Each layer is a component of this project, as explained in detail throughout the next sections.

### Sensing layer
The Sensing layer is a mobile wireless sensor network that gathers data from the city, using buses as mobility platform. Every node in this network is capable of gathering data, storing it and send it to the Flushing layer.

There should be one node per bus.

#### The Sensing Node

Every sensing node is cabable of gathering data, storing and transmitting it to a Flushing node. The Sensing Node follows an architecture presented on [1] and ilustrated here:

The devices used to implement each module are on teh following table:

| Module                 | Device         | Manufacturer    |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Controller             | Arduino UNO R3 | Arduino         |
| GNSS Receiver          | GS-96U7        | Guangzhou Xintu |
| SD Card Interface      | GS-96U7        | Guangzhou Xintu |
| Wireless Interface     | ESP8266        | Espressif       |

The sensor bank has the following sensors:

| Sensor                 | Device         | Manufacturer    |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Humidity               | DHT11          | DFRobot         |
| Temperature            | DHT11          | DFRobot         |
| Light Intensity        | GL5528         | GBK Robotics    |
| Rain Intensity         | YL-38          | 100y            |

The Controller and Wireless Interface are programmable devices. In the folder "sensing" of the current project, the codes used in each of them can be found.
